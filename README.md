# Hierarchical Structural Analysis

This repository collects the implementations of algorithms in the paper "A Hierarchical Structural Analysis Method for Complex Equation-oriented Models".

## Files in the repository

There are 6 files in this repository:

1. dae_analysis.py - The scripts for hierarchical structural analysis of dae models.
2. nla_analysis.py - The scripts for hierarchical structural analysis of nla models.
3. SSMatching.py - The python implementation of Soares and Secchi's algorithm in "Structural analysis for static and dynamic models".
4. read_graph.py - Generate graph from an edge list.
5. plot_graph.py - Plot the graph.
6. constant_def.py - Define constants used in the scripts.

## How to run

1. Load the script files in Python 2.7 environment.
2. run dae_analysis.py or nla_analysis.py to analyze singularity of example models.
